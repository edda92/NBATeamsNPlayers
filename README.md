Hi,
you’re going to do an application. Awesome, right?
It will be a real application, it has to build and run on a real device
(maybe, one day). So please, code this application like you usually do
everyday.
We do love basketball.
You have to do an “NBA Teams and Players” application. Let’s go!
The application will show a list of NBA teams in the very first
Activity.
Tapping on a Team, the application has to show the players list in a
Fragment. Tapping on a Player, the application has to show the
player’s information in another Fragment.
You choose both UX and UI of these behaviors.
Here some suggestions:
- To retrieve data, use this API Documentation:
https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/free-nba/endpoints
- The application’s usage has to be easy and clear.
- Think about architecture and design patterns even if it’s not a
big application
- Please use the Navigation component.
- We don’t love third party frameworks.
- We prefer Koin/Dagger for dependency injection.
- We love UnitTest [Not done yet for lack of time]
- We love clean code
Work on a local repository and commit as often as you can
When the work is done, you can upload the project on a git
repository, and send us the link.
Enjoy!
